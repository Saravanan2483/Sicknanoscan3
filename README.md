# 2D SLAM Mapping Application with Particle Filter Integration

A Python-based **2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** application that processes real-time LiDAR data (SICK nanoScan3) via UDP and integrates a **Particle Filter SLAM** algorithm to build occupancy grid maps.  

This project provides:
- Real-time **LiDAR scan visualization**
- **Particle Filter-based SLAM** for robust map generation
- Interactive **UI for visualization and controls**
- Map saving in `.smap` format  

---

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Receives **LiDAR data over UDP** from SICK nanoScan3  
- ✅ Implements **Particle Filter SLAM** (modular integration)  
- ✅ Real-time **LiDAR scan & occupancy map visualization**  
- ✅ **Start/Stop mapping controls** via UI  
- ✅ Save maps in **`.smap` format** (custom binary format with pose + map grid)  
- ✅ Configurable parameters for sensor and SLAM tuning  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tkinter` (comes preinstalled with Python on most systems)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Minimal `requirements.txt`:

```txt
numpy
matplotlib
```

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/2d-slam-particle-filter.git
cd 2d-slam-particle-filter
```

### 3️⃣ Configuration

Modify **UDP and SLAM parameters** inside the script as needed:

```python
BIND_IP = "192.168.192.5"   # Listening IP (use "0.0.0.0" for all interfaces)
PORT = 6060                 # Listening port
MAP_RESOLUTION = 0.1        # meters per pixel
MAP_WIDTH = 50.0            # meters
MAP_HEIGHT = 50.0           # meters
NUM_PARTICLES = 50          # Particle filter size
```

---

## 🖥️ Usage

### Run the Application

```bash
python slam_app.py
```

### UI Controls

* **Start Mapping** → begins Particle Filter SLAM
* **Stop Mapping** → stops processing
* **Save Map** → export map in `.smap` format
* **View Lidar / View Map** → switch between scan and map views
* **Check options** → toggle rays & robot pose visualization

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. Launch the program with your nanoScan3 connected.
2. Click **Start Mapping** to begin SLAM.
3. Visualize **real-time LiDAR scans** on the left and the **occupancy map** on the right.
4. Save your map anytime via **Save Map**.

---

## ⚙️ Dependencies

* **LiDAR sensor**: [SICK nanoScan3](https://www.sick.com/)
* **Python packages**:

  * `numpy` → efficient math operations
  * `matplotlib` → visualization & UI controls
  * `tkinter` → file dialogs & message boxes

---

## 🔧 Configuration Details

* **Filtering**: Ignores distances `< 30mm` or `> 30m`
* **Performance**: Caps max rays to `4000` for smooth rendering
* **Particle Filter**: Uses motion + measurement models, resampling, and likelihood weighting
